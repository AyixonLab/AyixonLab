- 👋 Hi, this is the official repository of the @AyixonLab
- 👀 We are interested in the species concept, xenobiotic bioremediation and genomics...inter alia
- 💞️ We are open collaborations! Feel free to contact us to: ayixon@gmail.com
- ⚡ *Some tools we have developed*:
  - A pipeline to deconvolve metagenomes with fine taxonomic contexts (*RaPDTool*)
  - A pipeline to classify prokaryotic and fungal genomes using an integrative conceptual framework (check out our *GenomeScanner*)
  - *Meta-core*, a series of scripts useful in microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS)
  - A serie of Mash databases including reduced representations of microbial assemblies from the type material
